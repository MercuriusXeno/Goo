  "block.mercurialtools.ender_keystone_description": "A keystone from the End, embossed with spatial distortion reagents. When you pass over it, you skip up to 32 blocks.$(br2)Can be tricky to use: $(li)Sprint across it to blink laterally in the direction you're mostly running. $(li)Jump while standing on it to blink upward. $(li)Sneak while standing on it to blink downward.",
  "block.mercurialtools.ender_keystone_description_extra": "If you jump off of it, it will grant you temporary slow falling proportionate to the power of the blink. In theory, you should only ever blink to a safe location. Unsafe warps that would disperse your molecules into solid matter should instead do nothing.",
  "block.mercurialtools.ender_keystone_dampened_description": "You can dampen an Ender Keystone with carpet to reduce its effects by half, up to 3 times. Using a piece of flint on any dampened keystone reverts it to a normal Keystone.",

  "block.mercurialtools.frugal_anvil_description_extra": "Perhaps just as importantly, the anvil cannot be damaged or destroyed.",
  "block.mercurialtools.growth_pulser_description": "A sea lantern enhanced to radiate growth to a 9x9x9 area. Guarantees a growth tick every ten seconds.",
  "block.mercurialtools.growth_pulser_description_extra": "This effect will not stack!",

  "block.mercurialtools.mercurial_grindstone_description_extra":  "There is no limit to the number of times repair costs can be lowered. Keep your favorite items... favorite. Books and Mercurial Blend go in the bottom slot, target item on top!",

  "item.mercurialtools.cubing_talisman_description_extra": "Deactivate by right-clicking (turns red). Stops cubing.",
  "item.mercurialtools.enchanting_star_description": "A crystalline star, wrested from a powerful foe. Its latent enchantment seems to endlessly imbue you with wisdom. As your experience grows, the experience it grants gets a bit slower.",

  "item.mercurialtools.mending_ember_description": "This ember seems to resonate with items enchanted with Mending. Instead of repairing when experience is collected, it will actively maintain items from your experience pool instead. The experience-to-durability ratio is effectively the same as it would be via collection.",
  "item.mercurialtools.mending_ember_description_extra": "Deactivate by right-clicking (turns to ash) to cease the active draining of experience for repairs.",
